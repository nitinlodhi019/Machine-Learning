🔍 What is SVM?
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks, but it's mostly used for classification.

Core Idea:
SVM tries to find the best boundary (hyperplane) that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.
