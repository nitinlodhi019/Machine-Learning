## ðŸ§  What is Softmax?

The Softmax activation function is used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification. It converts the raw output scores (logits) from the network into probabilities, such that:

* All probabilities are between 0 and 1.

* All probabilities add up to 1.
